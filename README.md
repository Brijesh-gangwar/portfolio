A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Environment setup

1) Install or ensure you have JDK 17+ — required for Android and language server features.

macOS (Homebrew):
```bash
brew install openjdk@17
sudo ln -sfn $(/usr/libexec/java_home -v 17) /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-17.jdk
```

2) Install Flutter and add it to PATH. Example:
```bash
# assuming you clone Flutter into ~/tools/flutter
export PATH="$HOME/tools/flutter/bin:$PATH"
```

3) Add to your shell rc (.zshrc or .zprofile) and restart terminal.

4) Restart VS Code, run `flutter doctor` and ensure all required tools are installed.
